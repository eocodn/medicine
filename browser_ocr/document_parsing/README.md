# Medication document parsing research

This package isolates document-structure parsing from OCR recognition quality.
It is research-only and does not reconnect OCR to the product.

## Boundary

Input fixtures contain only synthetic OCR boxes:

- recognized text
- recognition confidence
- four-point polygon geometry

Expected output is a set of medication rows shaped like the dormant medication
intake boundary: `product_query`, structured draft fields, and explicit
`uncertainty_codes`. Canonical product identity remains outside this layer.

The first benchmark is intentionally model-free. Geometry/rule baselines can be
added later, and learned document/KIE models should only be considered after a
measured baseline shows that layout variation cannot be handled safely enough.

## Safety metrics

The evaluator separates three outcomes that must not be conflated:

- exact structured fields that match the expected medication
- unresolved fields left empty for later review
- false exact fields, especially values copied from another medication row

`cross_medication_associations` is the critical association metric. A parser
that cannot prove a field association should leave that field unresolved rather
than borrowing a plausible exact value from another medication.

## Agent Control CLI

Validate the tracked synthetic corpus:

```sh
docker compose run --rm ocr-document-parse \
  validate-corpus \
  --corpus browser_ocr/document_parsing/corpus/manifest.json \
  --json
```

Evaluate a prediction file:

```sh
docker compose run --rm ocr-document-parse \
  evaluate \
  --corpus browser_ocr/document_parsing/corpus/manifest.json \
  --predictions /workspace/path/to/predictions.json \
  --json
```

Prediction files use schema version 1 and contain one `case_id` plus `rows` per
evaluated case. An empty `rows` list is valid fail-closed output.
